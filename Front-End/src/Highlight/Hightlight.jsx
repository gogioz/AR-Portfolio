          In the mid-December cold, the young man with European features left
          his home in the Cairo neighborhood of Doqqi, passing by a building
          marked “owned by artist Mohamed Rushdi”. <br /> <br /> The building
          hosted a small gym, outside of which several young men usually
          loitered, their imposing bodies covering a faded yellow wall, whose
          color, with the crowd of boys in front of it, broke up the normally
          calm rhythm of the street, just a few meters from the racket of Tahrir
          Street. <br /> <br />
          He then passed into the din of the metro station and then into the
          quietness of a late Friday afternoon at the beginning of Qasr al-Aini
          Street. <br /> <br /> From there, he made his way to two open rooms
          ringing with a different kind of cacophony—the dreams and hopes of
          Egyptian union leaders. <br /> <br />
          At the Center for Trade Union and Workers’ Services, trying to avoid
          all the video and still cameras, he stood in a corner following
          speeches by union leaders and labor activists. <br /> <br />
          Sharp and direct, they vehemently attacked the government because of a
          publication it had issued calling for the boycotting of independent
          unions. According to his friends, the force of the meeting and the
          courage of the speakers left the young man in shock. <br /> <br />
          But someone snapped his photo, which made him uneasy. By the end of
          the day, the feeling had turned to anxiety. It was the first time he
          had experienced such a feeling since his arrival in Cairo more than
          two months earlier, in mid-September, he confided to a friend the next
          day, according to al-Masry al-Youm sources who requested anonymity..
          After the meeting, Giulio Regeni made his way back to the streets of
          downtown Cairo, heading toward Strand Cafe in Bab al-Louq. <br />{" "}
          <br /> A graduate student at Cambridge University, he was on his way
          to meet Fatma Ramadan for the first time, the head of the independent
          union for tax collectors, one of the two unions on which his research
          was focused. He raised the subject of the CTUWS meeting, sparking a
          long conversation with the well-known union leader. <br /> <br />{" "}
          Ramadan remembers they disagreed in their assessment. Whereas he saw
          enthusiasm, she saw more of the same; where he saw courage, she saw
          mere talk. Summarizing their disagreement she says, “He was
          enthusiastic, impressed. I was frustrated and indifferent.” Sitting in
          a cafe a few meters from the one where she met Giulio for the first
          time, Ramadan recalls, “He seemed smart, kind, and sincere about what
          he was doing”. <br /> <br /> Two months before the meeting, to mark
          twenty years of living in Egypt, another Italian invited 100 of his
          friends, Egyptians and foreigners, to a party on the roof of a hotel
          in Doqqi overlooking the Nile. There in the autumn night, Giulio met
          Amr Asaad for the first time. A professor of business administration
          with a leftist leanings, Asaad later became one of Giulio’s closest
          friends in Egypt. <br /> <br />
          “Despite the age difference,” he says, “we became friends.” In October
          and November, the relationship was mostly academic. “I would help him
          find sources and we would have long talks about the little details,”
          Asaad says. In December and January, the friendship deepened. “We were
          bound by our love of art, so we became friends. He would talk to me
          about workers and unions, and love and art,” he says. <br /> <br />{" "}
          Asaad paints a picture of Giulio the researcher: “He was tireless,
          smart, and very serious.” He was loving. “He asked [for my advice]
          about the most romantic places he could take his girlfriend when she
          would visit him in Cairo.”. He was giving. “He was remarkably engaging
          with street vendors, talking to them and visiting them where they
          worked.” He was daring. <br /> <br />
